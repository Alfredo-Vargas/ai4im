# TODO LIST

- [ ] Implement Cross-Validations
    - The purpose of crossâ€“validation is to test the ability of a machine learning model to predict new data. It is also used to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias and gives insights on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset. 
    - Reasons for cross-validation:
        1. Used all your data.
        2. Get more metrics
        3. Prevents overfitting when using model stacking
        4. Work with dependent grouped data
        5. For parameters fine tunning
