- What are the time units? miliseconds?
- Error of time measurement?

- Ram position units?
- Error of ram position measurement?

- Injection pressure units? 
- Error of measurement?

- Sensor pressure units?
- Error of sensor pressure measurement?

- The Injection Moulding consists of 6 phases:
  1. Closing the mould (ram position vs time)
  2. Inject the material (injection pressure vs time)
  3. Pressing the material (sensor pressure vs time)
  4. Cool down the product (no data?)
  5. Open the mould (no data?)
  6. Eject the product (no data?)

- It is the Injection Moulding running? Can we visit?

- Can we predict that the product will have a defect (short shot, warping, flash)?
- What is the difference between Y2 and Y4?
